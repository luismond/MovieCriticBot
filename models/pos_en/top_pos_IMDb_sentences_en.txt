It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures .

Also , the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting .
He also handled the role very well .
The entire action is one big absurdity , but it 's mindless fun at its best .
Either way , it 's a grievous loss to both genre fans , and casual viewers alike .

He is , in my oppinion , the greatest of all time .
He claims an angel visits him , and tells him that they need to kill demons .

There 's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers .
Their short partnership must have been a harmonious one , with ' give and take ' about how to do things .
That 's a measure of strength for that first cast .
I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is .
Burton fans will sure like it , others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism .
All my friends were really surprised it ended .
My only complaint is that more characters were not included more .
It even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it was not overdone .

My personal favourite part is the ' guerrillas in the midst ' section .
The best thing is the laughter never stops .

What makes this film good is the fact that it 's not overly melodramatic .
And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention .
The whole movie is hunting and involving , filled with a wide range of deep feelings ...
I 'd watch it again ... with a girl .
Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child .
They are our sad history and they are our present .
The characters are fully realized , and the portrayals are fantastic .
It is , rather , a very human drama which even viewers who do not know boxing will be able to connect with .
The one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway .

The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail .

The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved ...
The musical score is endearing and heart warming .

Rainer helps in the field , bears and raises the kids , does the housework .
I watched the first , second , third and all the other episodes .

This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them .
Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film .
This movie has really great deaths .
There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect .
The story never really got lost in this frantic pace .

A few days later they met again , and he asked what he had done to upset her .
I ca not say the same for the epics of today .
I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it .
As its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending , but that only makes it a better movie .
Very , very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish .
It 's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false .
These truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them .
In that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is , thus being credible .
On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops .
It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film .
Anyway , the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny .
They personalize perfectly the characters .

The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good .
In a powerful scene , the music is more stronger then in the original versions .
He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all .
It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence .
I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them .
He is incredibly handsome , in a modest , relaxed way that is irresistible .
Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time .
Tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly .
And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears .
I was really surprised with this movie .
If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely .

His style is completely natural and completely hilarious .
I saw it at an independent film festival , so do not expect it to come to your town anytime soon .
It 's called blonde and blonder , so do not expect profound and meaningful jokes .
But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film .

Otherwise it 's a bit strange , that she would carry his baby and love it .

It 's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately .
It 's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately .
The rest of the cast was very good , also .
Get this , watch it , learn from it .
This applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras .
However , in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film .
I think the writer director is great .
Especially without the original cast .
The rest you will be able to work out for yourself .
It is stringently nonpolitical without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied .
Why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out , especially the good ones .
Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too .
I like the different approaches this movie takes .
In this version , it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie .

I watched and enjoy this show because it was gross , offensive , hilarious , and raunchy .

It 's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices .

The two leads always have to get together .
This film is the sum of many , many instances of great acting and great casting .
The story is of little importance anyway , with the film succeeding on a cinematic level , not a narrative one .
This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed .
The actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick .
I know sometimes it s really really corny ...
There were some great shots of scenery in this film , and great car chases and a lot of spirituality .
There are many twists and surprises in the film .
Most of the other characters are interesting as well .
Funny but not as good as the first film .
It 's entertaining to say the least .
Who knows , maybe you will disagree with my opinion and maybe you wo not .
Anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light .
All in all , a very nice piece of work .
The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate .
Colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back .
It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments .
These three personalities bounce off of each other very well .
The whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool .
Her air time in the film was pretty short though .
Siodmak 's use of sex , light , shadows , and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre .
Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own .
This pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in .

Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances .
The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall .

This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity .
What does change mean without reflection .

Even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent , friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie .
The movie may have been done in black and white , but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end .
It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity .
But strangely , there is a message in it .
It 's well done as per the novel , but somewhat irritating as per today 's kind of life .
I saw this important intense film tonight .
Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation , this is probably one of most uninspiring

If it is shown again on a cable station , catch it .
The emotional expression was very believable , which caused my emotions to spill out .
She cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks .
But all in all a good , clean , decent family movie .
Life ebbs and flows like a river , and it has it 's rough spots , but it is a wonderful trip .
But by that point , she has no option that is without great pain for her .
Considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into , this criticism would seem to have some validity .
The pace is a trifle slow , and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes .
I remember this film from many years ago .
Indeed , at places , the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic .

Of course , the main thing about this movie is that it 's fun to watch .
Some of these dreams are so unattainable it 's tragic .
The realization of the modern machinery is very effective .
Watch this show with a open mind , it 's worth it .
It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted .
For most of the songs , the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people .
It was unlike any movie we 'd ever seen before .
Especially when you compare the endings .

An odd move , but a great one , as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly .

My short comment for this flick is go pick it up .
She actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here .
Lines seem more improvised than scripted .
Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again .

But this is different and just focuses on being funny .
I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean , funny and adventurous .
That other person is not going to wait a life time waiting , they have a life a well .
All in all , the story is enchanting family entertainment .

It is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point .
Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the acting just took my breath away .

As it is , this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers .
I still want to see it again , but have not had time .
It 's also got a doozy of a plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message .
However , it 's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today .
It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end .
The number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love .

The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men ' may ' , not will , but ' may ' use during the game .

With this movie , you could play an interesting game , if you watch it with friends .

To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself .
So he goes in there , a fight breaks out , and some things get knocked over , dangerous things .
There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots , but also very chilling and even daring moments .

Still it s required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale , or even a great movie .
When the truth comes out it is quite funny .
They have a great chemistry in their roles .
Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally .
First of all , the overall feel was intense , internalized , claustrophobic , and small .
The cast uniformly turns in some good performances .
Everyone should see this movie for the experience .
The two leads are great and really carry the film .
It 's not about pleasure of any kind , it 's about getting the desired reaction out of you .
It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror .
Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking .
Especially as he has the bruises to show for it .
He plays a diplomat , a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action .
The director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other .
She has been through a lot and has faced it .
This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor .
This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense .
The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off .
It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself .
Every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it .
I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck .
The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great .
The more important issue is that it does not always tell the story very effectively .
So great you might find yourself humming them time and time again .

The acting in this movie is well done .

Eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested .
By today 's standards , the animation is spotty .
This is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal .
Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool .
Modern sensibilities demand great drama .
The film captured this quite nicely .
It has a few lulls , which makes a complete sit through a bit hard , and it has some unexplained situations .
But we both chose that love anyway .
They start a fairly hard job and excel in no time .
Braveheart is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy .
It should have been cruder , to match we saw in the original series .
But , hey , that 's the nature of people .
However , the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people .

On that level , it 's pretty damn good .

Simply put , the film does not take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it .
A lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out .

It leaves the viewer a lot to think about .
The direction is nearly perfect , with several very memorable moments .
How these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible .
The other players are letter perfect .
Another beautiful , funny , and truly original film from a thrilling director who has not come close to his apex .

This time , he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy .
I also liked the old man in the beginning .
Not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline .
The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets .
The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts , and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film .
As the movie envelopes around the two love birds , it also manages to find its lens towards
Another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along .
A nice film to watch on a sunny day .
In short , time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light .

When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect .
That is perhaps what makes it so intense .
This is not only my favorite silent comedy , but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time .
The plot is cleverly crafted , story is believable .
Sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before .
It also reminds us to be careful what we wish for .

This movie does not rank in the all time great category , but it is pretty entertaining .
This movie surprised me in a good way .
It represents absolutely everything good , fun and magical about my childhood .

Subtle , and all about the interactions of the characters .
Even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again .

She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film .

I voted excellent for how well the acting was , not for the content .
You cry , you laugh , you hate and you identify .
It is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me .
You can not claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical .
I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it .
It certainly takes a number of viewings .
It 's a loving story about family , friendship , and the kindness of strangers .
The last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season .
And the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters .
This makes her character 's plight all the more believable .

From there , the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe .

I m obsessed with it , and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie .
Unlike so many movies of this genre , the script is very very tight .

I would definitely recommend it to everyone .
The film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological .
Well , magic works in mysterious ways .
I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised .
We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents .
On a deeper level though , it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land .

But , that being said , it is a fine film , worth a viewing .
This is one of the funniest films of the year .

It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly .
He was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face .
The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect .
Suspend belief and enjoy , this is truly time well spent .
At times having to swim in dangerous waters , alone , frightened , injured , she always managed to keep going .
I love the childlike humor and appreciate it .
It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch .
All the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional .

It 's a good movie but not one of their best .

It 's a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue , thrills , and suspense , including an exciting final twist .
It 's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience .
It 's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth .

It is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity .
Corbin makes a great creepy dentist .
It 's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled .

This movie is one of my very favorites .
Che or , better , if they do not think highly of him .
The end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop .
Slightly lesser sequel , but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first .
The ending is also unexpected and believable .
The action is superb from beginning to end , and there 's not much time to breathe in between .

A very good pilot though for a very good series .
It does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house .
The movie has a lot of good things about it .

The outcome , the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all .
This really captures the heart of the book .
It 's a rich , warm novel brought to the screen , beautifully acted , and well directed .
All together , this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .
The story and characters eventually wind down to what you 'd hope will happen , and that 's fine .
You ca not watch it again until you 've seen it the first time .
Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time .
A delightful family film , which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone .

This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you .
The language is awesome and passionate .
The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project .
This was way more darker and real world .
Good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good .

But if you are a rap fan , even a casual one , you will love the inside jokes and references .

Pickford is , as always , a pleasure to watch .
The movie deals with family relationships , love , and finding someone who understands .
Todd is a consummate professional , and an all around nice guy .
It 's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first .
He is sensitive for several reasons .
This is a strange , cerebral , surreal , esoteric film .
It is in the essential change of nature where his work , though complete in its own sphere , is made whole .
There a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well .
I even liked most of the actors in it .
The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching .
It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie .
This was a delightful presentation .
Thanks to all for reading my comment .
In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie .
Also the freedom that comes from that .
It 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance .
Lee is , as always , superb in his role .
I hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one .
I recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends .
And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece .
The costumes and makeup were flawless as well .
This kind , fun loving woman had a great deal of money .
It shoves noir in our faces , and it is not necessary .
The characters are what makes the movie so good .
I can still remember the characters vividly .
Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film .
Like any really fine film , it 's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming .
But it still is captivating and interesting .
The cinematography is excellent as expected .
I thought the whole cast was suitable , and found the film pretty enjoyable , all in all .
Other versions have blown it , but this gets it right .

Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role , which works brilliantly in this case .
Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns .

Very well directed , and the acting is great .
I found it through a rare video dealer , and it was certainly worth it .

The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways .
Acceptance of oneself , of human condition , though its overall difficulties , is the real purpose of the film .
Acceptance of oneself , of human condition , though its overall difficulties , is the real purpose of the film .
The ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity .
It 's a simple hook , but it works .
The last section of the film , the grand dance sequence , is very impressive .
When he freaks out , it 's for several good reasons and ... well , see the film for the whole story .
They must have improvised during some parts and it works well .
It is a beautifully filmed human story .
But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done .
Considering history , though , the film 's impact was minimal at best .
Just watch for one of the most heart warming , beautifully acted , poignant scenes ever filmed .
Nevertheless , it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .
In some ways , he even surpasses the master .
The acting was , of course , wonderful .
The film transcends into a dark film noir , with a couple of truly excellent scenes , and an even better finale .
Yes , she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily .
Buy it or do not , but the message is still there .
All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles .

All around enjoyable , sweet , funny , gross etc ......
I can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years .
She also makes friends and experiences much in a short time .
This film id a true example of man vs. nature and sometimes man vs. man .

This was one of the all time best episodes .
The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved , so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this .
Try the concert out , it really is amazing .
It takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky .
A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses .
You will not find any deep message in this movie , but it 's worth watching .
The story of the film is not especially deep , but it 's a pretty good fantasy tale .
If you want good laughs and a fun time , make sure to watch this movie .
It 's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force .
It is overly exaggerated at times , and there is some crude humor , but overall it manages to be somewhat funny .
Sabu 's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie .
This is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about .

It 's a beautiful film to watch , and if you like wildlife footage , you should find this fascinating .
This was a great movie with a good cast , all of them hitting on all cylinders .
The moments where we find out both their secrets , if that is what you can call it , is a great moment .
Certainly the best this year until now .
The emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal .
For one , it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are .
I thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .... and that 's my opinion .
For that , one must delve into the print versions of the plays .
Combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot , and you have a masterpiece .
There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future .
Add them all up and you get the best comedy you 've never heard of .
Cinderella herself is , in my opinion , one of the greatest characters
I thought it was quite nice for the piece .
That 's rare for a movie in this category .
This is truly one entertaining movie .
There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant .
This first film was one of the best .
The film is based on the lives of real people .
This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time .

Still , it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .
This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action .
Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films .

I say if a film makes you want to see what happens next , it 's a good film .
It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine .
This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting .
It is a film about people and their lives , their mistakes , and their triumphs .
This movie has great style , fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman .
But , if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons , it s.. not good .
It was originally a play ... and it shows .
The films deal with dark themes at time .
Her timing was great and her expressions were priceless .
It is clever , it is a twisted view , but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed .
His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants .

It actually takes a lot out of you to watch .
But it 's a lot of fun , and there are some fine performances .

This is a better than average silent movie and it 's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents .
I labeled this crime movie a film noir because it 's gritty and the all the characters are no good .
Some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience .
I think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone .

Not a laugh riot , but a more subtle , sophisticated humor .
It maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing .
Sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making .....
This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story .
